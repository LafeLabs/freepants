    <P>LET'S MAKE 1 BILLION CARDBOARD CUBES!</P>
    
    <P>BILLIONS OF TONS OF CARDBOARD ARE THROWN OUT PER YEAR!  NOT POUNDS TONS!!! LET'S CAPTURE JUST A TINY SLIVER OF THAT TO MAKE 1 BILLION CUBES!  THIS IS THE CHALLENGE!</P>
    
    
    <P>CUT OUT CARDBOARD TRASH INTO THE SIDES, STACK THEM 3 HIGH FOR SINGLE CORRUGATED 2 HIGH FOR DOUBLE CORRUGATED!  4 SIDES PER CUBE! DO THE SAME WITH THE BOTTOM!  USE ELMER'S GLUE TO STACK!  ASSEMBLE WITH GLUE!  GLUE SQUARES TO THE OUTSIDE AND DECORATE WITH INFORMATION ON REPLICATING THE CUBE!  PUT HYPERSIGNS IN THE CUBE!</P>
    
    
    <P>
        BUILD A CUBE AND GET A PRIZE!  BUILD MORE CUBES AND GET MORE PRIZES!  SHOW OTHERS HOW TO COPY CUBES AND GET EVEN MORE PRIZES! INFINITE PRIZES!
    </P>
    
    <p>we can give cubes to people who can then sell them.  point the web pages to the cubes point the cubes at the web pages.</p>
    
    
    <p>GET DIMENSIONS FROM THIS DIAGRAM, THOSE RULERS HAVE INCH AND HALF INCH MARKINGS ON THEM:</p>

    <P>
        THIS IS THE LAYOUT OF THE BOTTOM, RULERS SHOW THE INCH AND  HALF INCH MARKINGS. COPY THESE TO GET THE BOTTOM PATTERN:
